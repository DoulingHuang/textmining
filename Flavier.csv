I received a Scotch taster box with 3 samples, and the Lowland single malt Glenkinchie 12 Year is what I am starting with. I don\'t know what the typical notes are in a Scotch, or if there are even ""typical"" notes, so I\'ll do my best to give an honest and accurate review. If you\'re a Scotch virgin like me, this review may be just what you\'re looking for.\r\rThe nose is bright and light with honey sweetness, slight fruit, cereal, and some underlying smokiness. There is something about the nose that reminds me of white wine, but I\'m not a wine guy so who knows what that means? The mouthfeel is smooth and oily with a palate that is sweet, light, and fruity. There are not a lot of standout flavors so describing this whisky in anything but general terms is difficult. The finish is moderate with an earthy smoke and apple followed by a bit of mint. I suspect that this is a good introductory Scotch and is easy to drink. There was nothing in here that scares me away from Scotch, but also nothing to bring me back. Scotch cocktails are not something I am familiar with, but I would imagine this would be a good one to use in a cocktail. It\'s fine.'], ['Definitely need to drink it water back.

I\'ve never tried scotch before as I\'ve always been into bourbons, so my introduction to scotch was not exactly as I expected.  I found this particular taste to be I guess ""narrow""... not much depth.  The taste hit at the front of my tongue, but not really anywhere else.

A lot smoother with the water. A lot sweeter now. Earth tones. A confusing Scotch whisky. Long, dull finish. Won't be buying this one.""], ['Honey, sharp'], [""Flavor spiral was fairly accurate but in my opinion I was surprised smoky didn't make the list. I felt it had abut of a smoky aftertaste.

A flavor palate of cereal, grass, vanilla, and creamy fruit gave way to a long peppery, slightly smoky finish. A splash of water popped this whisky wide open!

Lagavulin 16 Year Old,"Appearance / Color?
Deep amber gold

Nose / Aroma /?Smell
Intensely concentrated flavor, massive peat smoke with ultra-intense iodine. The fruity-sherry notes, vanilla and Lapsang Souchong.

Flavor / Taste / Palate
A rich, dried fruit sweetness of the sherry character with clouds of smoke and strong, barley-malt flavors. At the back of the mouth is an explosion of salty and peppery smoke.

Finish 
Huge, long, warming and peppery with a distinct appetizing sweetness. A little spice lightens the grip of the peat and vanilla.

Thus far, my experience with Scotch has been...fine. I am a bourbon guy, and while I can appreciate a good Scotch, it doesn\'t seem like something I would choose to imbibe.

There have been some distinct flavors, but nothing too bold and certainly nothing I would say is complex, which has often been my experience and perception of bourbon. I view Scotch as the white wine to bourbon\'s red. That said, this third and final taste is, from what I have observed as a Scotch outsider, the ""best"" one. One that is well regarded and sought after. I know this label is the favorite of my older brother, so I expect to have one of two little brother experiences with this dram: I will either be excited that I can share in the enjoyment of something my older, wiser, and more sophisticated brother has said is good or I will confirm, once and for all, that he is an ignorant boob and I am the superior son.

I didn\'t give myself time to savor the first sip and identify any flavors because I did not anticipate I would like it. I notice that the mouthfeel is oily and smooth and the palate is just as smokey and peaty as the nose. There is no finish to speak of and there is a slightly sweet, slightly woody aftertaste.

This is one of the few scotches where I completely disagree with Flaviar's spiral - there is next to no smokiness in this scotch. It's very lightly peated. The nose is sweet and inviting - caramel, vanilla, spice. The palate follows but expands into bright fruits, more caramel and lots of delicious oak. The slightest hint of peat appears as you let the scotch expand on your palate. Some light peat (in this case, different from smoke) comes in during the finish and the oak really cements itself. Being non-chill filtered, higher ABV and E150 free really makes this a top-notch 12 year. Thick, oily mouthfeel.

I can see why they call this a chewing whisky, it makes you want to chew on the taste long after the dram is down. The after taste lingers for quite a long time and mellows and is very pleasant to mingle with. Reminds me of cigars; I feel like I need to be wearing a smoking jacket whilst enjoying this dram.This is a great selection for a smokey whisky.

I personally enjoy my single malt scotches that take the palette on a flavor journey - a subtle unfolding of flavor spirals on the palette.  This 12-year single malt from the Highlands was satisfying - it just isn't my personal preference. My favorite scotch is any scotch that creates intrigue from the start - bold in nose, deftly nuanced in flavor spirals that are genuinely detectable and each working in harmony to reveal its origins, and a long strong finish.""], ['I think these are usually priced the same as the Quinta Ruban, but found that this was not as enjoyable as the other.

The UK Edradour is smoother and richer than the one with the US seal.  The difference is so marked that unless it has the UK seal, I generally won't buy it.  It's a highland scotch and as an Isley girl, I still put it at top rating because it's so good. If you ever get a chance to visit the distillery, I highly recommend it! So much of what they make is downright amazing, and the tour of the distillery is really great! I've introduced this to many people over the years, and everyone goes back for more.""]]"

I was recommended to stay away from peated scotch and islays in general for my first scotch, but the smokey finish was probably my favorite part of the drink. I was hesitant on first smell but aquired the taste for it on my first glass.\r\rOver about a week I finished off the bottle drinking a glass or two neat in the afternoon and I couldn't be more happy. At 40ABV I wasn't surprised of the pungent boozy smell, but beneath the initial smell I noticed a light smoke and sweet citrus. On the first sip the orange peel notes and subtle caramel notes were what I picked up first, but with time in glass I picked up a prominent honey taste and the smokey finish mellowed out. \r\rWould recommend neat, this was too tasty to dilute.""], ['Excellent spirit for the price.

The peat is on the light side, like highland Park but without the Sherry influence all I taste is old socks, cheap salt and watered down to near crap.

The salt is the number one aroma followed by a wonderful sweet tangerine or even tropical fruit.  You can tell this is affected by the briny sea, but it’s a far cleaner brine than the Islays.  The oak isn’t overpowering and it seems as if the bourbon influence is minimal.  Very surprised at the deep tropical fruit that moves from nose to taste to finish.

I\'m glad I went with a full flavor cigar. They are complementing each other well. The scotch is smooth and velvety so it takes the black pepper spicey edge off the Opus blend. It\'s also bringing more of a leather flavor out of the cigar when I usually get prominent cedar notes from Opus... to be honest, with this pairing, this scotch almost tastes like a rum.

I emphasize the singularly rounded because it's very straight forward. It''s not as complex as the 10 or the Uigeadail which makes it more accessible. If you're looking at your first Ardbeg, aren't already a smoke head, or aren't into really complex flavors, then this is the Ardbeg for you. Ten - As stated on the bottle: sea spray, tarry rope, immense smoky intensity. More smoke than An Oa and a bit more complex. I prefer it over the An Oa because I like the extra phenol to balance it out. Consider this the definitive / standard Ardbeg. Uigeadail - Also from the bottle: Deep smoke with raisiny tones from old sherry casks This one is my personal favorite. It's rich and complex, sweet and smoky, but not what I would recommend for those new to the higher end Islay scotch. It's about 10% higher ABV than the others (bottled at 54.2%) and they sherry adds a rich and heavy sweetness which may be over the top in comparison to the light, zesty sweetness of the Ten.""], ['nice smoke flavor'], ['Hands down the best Ardbeg to me.

At $35, my wallet was eager to let me.\r\rThe nose is citrusy sweet with orange and honey dominating and the smell of the charred oak tagging onto the end.

As it hits the back of the tongue, the flavor brings the spice of cinnamon and pepper with the charred oak becoming more prominent. The finish is moderately long and pleasant with lingering honey, vanilla, and faint chocolate. I almost hesitate to add yet another positve review to the growing library of Eagle Rare commentary lest the fine folks at Buffalo Trace finally wise up and charge what this bottle is worth.

Smell / Nose

	A slight smell of corn, with a mix of fruity and spicy aromas tingling around the presence of vanilla and dark chocolate.

Writers Tears Copper Pot,"Appearance / Color
Classic malt, rich yellow gold.
?
Nose / Aroma / Smell
The aroma reminds us of honey and marmalade streaking the fruity barley.
?
Flavor / Taste / Palate
The first thing you notice about Writer’s Tears is the lovely round body and full rich flavor, very smooth initially, but developing a little tingle or slight pepperiness on the palate. It's very aromatic and floral malt with a faint suggestion of lemon right in the end — a hint of citrus and an initial flourish of spicy, malty sweetness that quickly leaves the stage to drier, firmer characters.
?
Finish
The honey-marmalade comes back as an echo of the aroma to provide the final moments of a decently long finish.","[['There are many Irish Whiskey varieties: grain Whiskey, malted barley pot-still-distilled, and ‘pure pot-still’ or ‘single pot still’ as it is now officially known.

Very smooth. \r\rIsaac Bernheim immigrated to the United States in 1867 with only $4 in his pocket — while he intended to work in New York City upon his arrival, his future employer went out of business and as a result, Bernheim became a traveling salesman, riding his horse throughout rural Pennsylvania and peddling goods to housewives until his horse died.\r\rBernheim then moved to Paducah, Kentucky and became a bookkeeper for a liquor wholesaler, eventually saving enough money to bring his brother Bernard to the United States. In 1872, Isaac and his brother established their own company — Bernheim Brothers — and together purchased a distillery in Louisville, Kentucky and began to produce I.W. Harper Bourbon. While I.W. stood for “Isaac Wolfe”, the given name of the older Bernheim, the brothers chose the name “Harper” over their own surname because it, “sounded more American.”\r\rBernheim Distillery was one of just ten distilleries granted permission to operate during Prohibition for medicinal purposes, and I.W.

I had seen the 15 year in its beautiful bottle and thought, ""There must be something wonderful in there,"" but the brand had not appeared in reviews, discussions, or top lists that I had seen. The fact is, other than the 15 year, I wasn\'t sure what else, if anything, was even in the I.W. Harper line. This has a lot to do with the fact that the brand was pulled from the U.S. market in the mid-90s and sold primarily in Europe and Asia, only returning stateside in the last few years. I strolled into a neighborhood liquor store the other day and was delighted to see that they had I.W. Harper Straight Bourbon Whiskey. While the bottle itself didn\'t look quite so nice as the 15 year, the label and color scheme definitely put out an air of sophistication. At only $32, I thought it worth purchasing as the first bourbon I would own with no prior knowledge of its reputation or attributes.\r\rThe Harper has a nice dark golden brown color and comes in at a sure to be smooth 82 proof. The nose is gentle with vanilla and oak, maybe some corn, and not much else. There is no age statement, other than it being a straight bourbon, but it smells like a young bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth and not quite dry, but almost. The palate has a citrusy sweet profile with orange, vanilla, light brown sugar, and a nice cinnamon bite on the back of the tongue. The finish is moderate with oak and leather standing out along with a lingering sweetness. This is a good bourbon that I can sip neat or use in a cocktail. A higher proof or more time in the barrel, or both, would bring this bourbon to the next level, but as it stands this is just a pretty good bourbon and a pretty good price. I would say that while this label is not a must-have, it is worth trying and certainly makes me think the 15 year is probably outstanding.']]"

Finish is well-balanced with a few more notes of cinnamon, clean with a touch of leather.\u2028\u2028Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is made in Kentucky using a generations-old mash recipe. After the grains are mashed and fermented, they are distilled to a lower proof than at other distilleries in Kentucky, meaning that less water is used in diluting the bourbon before it is matured and bottled. Following distillation, the bourbon is aged for at least 10 years in virgin American oak casks that have been charred with a #4 char. Typically, the degree of charring within a cask is measured on a scale of one to four, with a #1 char referring to casks that have been slightly toasted, and a #4 char referring to casks that have been charred so heavily that the interior resembles an alligator hide (the latter are nicknamed alligator-charred casks). The heavy char contributes bold notes of vanilla, cinnamon and oak to Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Bourbon, and compliments its notes of honey and cloves.\u2028\u2028Each batch of Russell's Reserve 10 Year Old Bourbon is crafted from only a handful of casks, each of which is personally selected by Russell and his son, Eddie (together, the pair have over 80 years of experience making bourbon). In addition, the casks selected are exclusively from the center of Wild Turkey's rickhouse, which Russell believes is the best area for maturing bourbon.""], ['I like it, a great everyday drinker'], ['Has the perfect taste going down as well as after taste.

The nose is pretty rich but one note. The palette is complex but confused, definitely leaning more towards a rye than a bourbon but not really doing either justice. The mouthfeel and finish is where I think the wheels fall off the bus. The mouthfeel is very light and frankly astringent. I would be disappointed if this bottle cost half what it does. Maybe I'm just not the targeted audience but it's a hard pass for me.""], ['Surprisingly smooth! Has the nose of a rye, but no burn. Think mouthfeel, silky and long finish.

Copperhead owns and operates Kentucky Artisan Distillery, which is rumored to now supply approximately 25% of the bourbon used in Jefferson’s Very Small Batch Bourbon.\r\rJefferson’s Small Batch\xa0is\xa0a blend of small batch Bourbons. While no exact ratio of barrels is given, Jefferson’s states that “four different Kentucky straight bourbon whiskies of different ages...one of the blends comprising of at least 55% of the total” are blended together to form each very small batch. \xa0Since the Bourbons that make up this blend are chosen as needed to maintain the character of the product, an age statement is not possible.'], ['Very smooth going down with a nutty flavor.

Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 24 Year Old Bourbon,"Appearance / Color
Oak brown.

Nose / Aroma / Smell 
Aromas of oak and vanilla on the nose, followed by caressing brown sugar, chocolate and leather.

Flavor / Taste / Palate 
Flavors of orchard fruits, oak, vanilla and anise, with subtle notes of spicy cinnamon and honey shine on the palate.

Finish
Warm and sweet finish of nutmeg and caramel.","[['It’s good but Too old.So much wood'], ['Really smooth and sweet. Not too much oak even though 24 years. More of an after dinner drink than a classic bourbon.'], ['For those unaware, this is the fifth iteration of the Orphan Barrel Rhetoric series. As far as we are aware, each whiskey comes from the same provenance, and the different age expressions allow one to travel through the oak maturation process. On to the whiskey:\r\rBefore Water\r\rNose: Candied cherries. Some other dried berries underneath. Blueberry honey. A bit of leather, wafting up from below. As it opens up a bit more, citrus peel. Smells like orange peel to my nose. Vanilla. Lots of vanilla at the end.\r\rPalate: Oak. Lots of oak. Leather/tannins coming through strongly. The dried cherry on the nose gives way to dried cherries on the palate, underneath the oak and leather. Further along, a bit of sourness and bitterness pierces through. Not unpleasant, mind you, but noticable. \r\rAfter Water (1/2 teaspoon):\r\rNose: Less of the candied cherries and dried fruit, more citrus peel. The honey and vanilla come on more strongly. A small hint of the leather from new shoes. \r\rPalate (after 1/2 teaspoon water): Still oak. Still leather. After the water, the oak and leather drown out a lot of the more subtle flavors, which I find unusual, as usually the opposite happens. After a while, the vanilla starts coming through. All in all, a very barrel-influenced bourbon, which is not surprising given its age.\r\rRating: 6 stars. This rating’s wholly a function of Flaviar’s price for this bottle. At around $165, which is what I paid for it, it goes up to an 8. Still, this bottle is not as good as the 23 year. The oak influence is becoming a bit too heavy and is drowning out the high-quality spirit. Still, if you find a good price, worth a buy.'], ['Wonderful bourbon. Leathery with cinnamon and oak. Rich and complex.']]"

Easy drinking'], [""One of my favorite Rye's right now""], ['Do not like this at all'], [""I don't really like. The profile is generally sweet, with a really strange butter pecan kind of finish. Very odd and not at all what I hoped for in a rye.""], ['Good nose, dark in color and smooth start to finish. Recommend Hayden Basil Dark Rye.'], ['Rich and sweet, like a dark cake still warm from the oven. The sweetness of the port melds with the spiciness of the rye.

Finish is good, but the beginning is just difficult to overcome.""], ['This whiskey would be an easy bottle to finish in one sitting. It’s that smooth.

Ok for mixing though.'], ['Best whiskey I have ever had.  It is my new #1!'], ['A great after dinner spirit.'], ['Really good. The flavor spiral shows much different than what I tasted.

The port definitely smooths out the taste and makes for a great drink neat.'], ['great for old fashioned'], ['Odd flavor profile. Tried it thinking it was port barrel aged and not port infused. Not something I would order again, but may be for you if you like a lot of port and berry.'], ['You first are welcomed by the caramel and floral aromas, but it isn’t strong— just enough to entice you to take a sip. It’s smooth, a good balance of the sweetness from the fruits and berries. As you sit waiting for the leaving flavor, the port wine makes itself known. The spicy part— or lack there of, only exists to tickle your lips and make you want to sip again. Very enjoyable. On second sip you can taste the port taking a bigger stand, and the “spicy” diminishes.'], ['The spice is dominates the flavor profile but is complimented by the fruit and berry immediately following. Certainly not bad, not a favorite though'], ['I’m a big fan of the Beam Distillery’s craft offerings, so I gave this a shot even though I’m not a fan of a Port.  The smoothness helps to make this pleasurable and I notice a great deal of dried fruit.  I’m glad I gave this a try!'], ['Smell:. Stinging oak and burnt-ish Caramel.\rTaste:Caramel, oak and spice forefront, barely a hint of dried fruit.\rFinish:. Dry and lots of that rye spice.\r\rOverall a great rye, with lots of that rye spiciness I love.  On the rocks the heavy oak is diminished and rye spice amplified.'], ['Enjoyed the smell.  Hints of spice and smooth, no strong.  Taste was very satisfying.  Spice, orange and a bit of the Brandy lingers.  Some may not like this depending on your taste preference, but nice for late night drink.'], ['If we’re talking drinkability, this gets a 10. Remarkably smooth, and extremely accessible to the new or experienced whiskey drinker. I just can’t help but feel like I want a little more out of my drink.  After three or four basil Hayden dark ryes, I’m left wanting. Especially for a rye, there is very little complexity or spice.'], ['Smooth finish'], [""Much too sweet up front for my taste, borderline cloying, but has a nice spicy finish that at least makes it drinkable. Still, I find myself wishing it was just the rye without the port. Going to try in a cocktails or two to see how it mixes, but don't think I'd ever get this one again.""], ['Weird after taste mixed with a bad fake syrup flavor makes this the worst Rye I have ever had.'], [""One of the best things I've had. The port does not take a way from the rye flavor, it adds a little sweet and smooth.""], ['Smooth sweet taste. No bitterness.'], ['First time having dark Rye. Very smooth and sweet and this would be very good during winter months to come. I think it is a very nice Port and finish.'], ['Love it for the smoothness, sweet taste and hint of spice. Definitely will have this on hand in the winter/holiday season.'], ['Really smooth. The port is a great addition.'], ['Wonderful sweet rye!'], ['Outstanding drink, on the sweet side but not a problem for me. The problem is I keep drinking it and have a little to much.'], ['First time having a dark rye. Very impressed'], [""I like it!  I find some people are put off by the addition of some Port wine (i.e. it's not just finished in Port barrels), but if you think of it as a bottled cocktail, it's quite nice.""], ['I love the flavor of this the. Has a bit of sweetness that rocked the old fashioned I had. Now I drink it neat. So nice.'], ['As smooth as you would expect for a Basil Hayden but still flavorful. Lots of fruit and a little spice.

Awesome blend and def a go to for my shelf now!'], ['It is my new favorite whiskey!!'], ['Great! Smooth on the rocks!'], [""Very interesting! So I smell the port and caramel notes. Goes down smooth but definitely tastes like drinking a bottle of port with a touch of rye whisky added.

Nice with a few rocks, or better yet in a Manhattan!'], [""Incredibly unique, but the Port overpowers any rye spiciness. I'd rather drink a rye or a port.""], ['A sweet easy drinking liquor that still has a nice spicy rye kick. I’d advise people new to rye start with this. It’s sweet but still high quality that won’t disappoint the rye initiated.'], ['very nice'], ['Definitely unique.  The Rye Spice and the port hit at the same time.'], ['Delicious and has many flavors to balance on the tongue. May be a bit on the sweet side for those who like a little bite on the tongue or enjoy the Rye side of whiskey. I treat it like desert and only have one.'], ['One of my favorite one-off ryes. The port blend finish on this is amazing. It pairs will with steak and chocolate. What more could you ask for?'], ['Really not that spicy. The sweetness of the caramel and berry flavors really come through. Delicious rye!'], ['As a rye blended with port, expected a more flavorful taste. It has a nice smooth feel to it, although taste to me with port sweetness is closer to a highly refined Tennessee whiskey. The Two by Two likely more in line with my taste.'], ['This might be my favorite rye out there right now. This rye is as complex and sweet.

Didn't taste much like rye, but was still very good.""], [""I'm not a rye lover - or heck, not even much of  a whiskey drinker.  At least I wasn't until this Basil Hayden Dark Rye.  This port-finished dark rye is amazing.  If I could find it, I'd buy 10 cases of it right now. Seriously, it really is that good.""], ['Nose is oak and berries the port comes through here.

Bowman.\u2028\u2028Rowan was raised in Bardstown, and eventually studied law under Kentucky Attorney General George Nicolas. At the age of 26, Rowan was elected to the state's constitutional convention, and eventually served in the Kentucky State Legislature and United States Senate.
